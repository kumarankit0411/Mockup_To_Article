You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?
 
  - I have learned a lot of things till now. I have some experience with HTML but few things like <strong> and <em> were new to me. Binding a figure with its caption
    using <figure> and <figcaption> seemed a lot easier and prettier than what I used to do before. Also, I came to know about this super awesome markdown style for 
    writing notes like these. 

* What has been easy?
  - Learning about various kinds of elements had been easy for me.
 

* What has been difficult?
  - Umm, That's tough to answer. Because so far, nothing seemed difficult.
 
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  - Well, I just made sure that I keep on solving challenges and look for help on google for most of the problems. In this case, I looked upon google for some
    elements of HTML that I had known before. W3schools.com helped me a lot with understanding an element's function.
